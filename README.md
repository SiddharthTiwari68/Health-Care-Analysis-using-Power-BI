## Overview
The **Health Care Analysis** project aims to provide insights into patient health statistics, focusing on key health risks such as heart attacks, strokes, and other factors affecting overall health. This analysis helps understand the distribution of health risks across different demographics and provides actionable insights that can be used by healthcare professionals to improve patient care.

## Project Objectives
The report generated in this project covers the following key aspects:
- **Total Number of Patients Diagnosed**: A summary of the total number of patient records analyzed.
- **Percentage of Patients with a History of Heart Attack**: Insights into the proportion of patients who have previously suffered from a heart attack.
- **Percentage of Patients with a History of Stroke**: Analysis of the percentage of patients who have had a stroke.
- **Count of Female Patients Who Are Not Overweight**: Identification of the number of female patients who are not overweight.
- **Health Risk Categorization**: Distribution of patients based on different levels of health risk (e.g., normal, moderate, high, critical).
- **Average Weight by Occupation**: Analysis of average weight based on the patients' occupation.
- **Overweight Patients by Race**: Analysis of the number of overweight patients categorized by race.
- **Health Status by Age Group**: Identification of the number of patients with normal health in each age group.
- **Patients with High Health Risk Due to Smoking**: The number of patients who have a habit of smoking and are at high health risk.
- **Patients with Limited Exercise and Health Risk**: Count of patients who exercise less than 30 minutes a day and are at high or moderate health risk.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis includes health-related information of **5191 patients**. The data encompasses various factors such as age, gender, race, occupation, and health metrics like weight, history of heart attacks, and strokes.

## Key Visualizations
The Power BI report includes several key visualizations to provide an intuitive understanding of the data:
- **Total Patients and Female Not Overweight**: Highlighting the number of patients and focusing on the female demographic.
- **Health Risk Distribution by Age Group**: Visualizing health risk categories across different age groups.
- **Overweight Patients by Race**: A bar chart representing overweight patients segmented by race.
- **Average Weight by Occupation**: Analysis of weight distribution across various occupations.
- **Heart Attack and Stroke History**: Pie and donut charts showing the percentage of patients with a history of heart attacks and strokes.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides a comprehensive view of health risks across a diverse patient population. The insights derived from this report can be valuable for healthcare providers in making informed decisions to improve patient outcomes.
